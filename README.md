# MART
Framework for testing the robustness and health of a mesh network. The Mesh Automatic Robustness Testing framework aims to be abstract and easily extendible. Written in Python, the testing framework is extremely lightweight—comprising a single `.py` file—requiring only a Python interpreter to be installed.

# Requirements
- Tested using Python 3.11.3, although other versions of Python 3 will likely be compatible.
- Client and server must have OpenSSH installed.
